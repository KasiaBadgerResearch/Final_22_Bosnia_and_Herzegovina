# How has the share of women in vulnerable employment evolved relative to that of men in Bosnia and Herzegovina between 1991 and 2023?

## Abstract

Using World Bank World Development Indicators (WDI), this study examines the evolution of vulnerable employment among men and women in Bosnia and Herzegovina from 1991 to 2023. Over this thirty-two-year period, both male and female vulnerable employment shares declined overall, reflecting gradual improvements in labor market stability. Female vulnerable employment began at a significantly higher level - about ten percentage points above the male rate — but the two converged around 2015, suggesting narrowing gender disparities. However, following this convergence, the female share began to rise again while the male rate continued to decline moderately, leading to a renewed divergence. These trends highlight both progress and persistent challenges in achieving equitable and secure employment across genders, emphasizing the need for sustained labor policy attention to gender-specific vulnerabilities.

## 1. Question

How has the share of women in vulnerable employment evolved relative to that of men in Bosnia and Herzegovina between 1991 and 2023?

- **Female employment proxy**: Vulnerable employment, female (% of female employment)
- **Male employment proxy**: Vulnerable employment, male (% of male employment)

## 2. Data

- **Source**: World Bank World Development Indicators (WDI)
- **Indicators**:
  - Vulnerable employment, female (% of female employment)
  - Vulnerable employment, male (% of male employment)
- **Coverage**: Bosnia and Herzegovina, 1991–2023
- **Notes**: National-level data only

## 3. Method

1. Filtered dataset for Bosnia and Herzegovina.
2. Selected relevant columns: Year, Indicator Name, Value.
3. Pivoted male and female vulnerable employment indicators into separate columns and sorted by year.
4. Produced a dual-axis line graph comparing gender-specific trends in vulnerable employment.

(Analysis is descriptive; no causal inference applied.)

## 4. Results

- **Female vulnerable employment (% of female employment)**: Declined sharply over time, from significantly higher levels in the early 1990s to convergence with male rates around 2015.
- **Male vulnerable employment (% of male employment)**: Declined more gradually but consistently across the same period.
- **Comparison**: The two indicators converged around 2015 before diverging again, as the female rate began to increase slightly while the male rate continued to decline.

## 5. Interpretation

- Bosnia and Herzegovina’s experience demonstrates the complex dynamics of labor market transformation during post-socialist transition and European integration.
- The initial gender gap—where women were far more likely to be in vulnerable forms of work—reflected structural barriers such as occupational segregation, informal sector concentration, and limited access to stable employment.
- The convergence around 2015 suggests progress toward gender equality in labor market conditions, potentially linked to formalization efforts, educational expansion, and targeted employment policies.
- The subsequent re-divergence, however, indicates persistent vulnerabilities among women, possibly tied to care responsibilities, part-time or informal work, and uneven recovery from economic shocks.
- These findings underscore that reducing gendered labor insecurity requires not just economic growth but also inclusive labor market reforms, access to social protection, and gender-sensitive employment programs.

## 6. Limitations

- Modeled ILO estimates may not fully capture informal or unpaid work, particularly in rural and household contexts.
- National-level data mask regional and sectoral variations in employment vulnerability.
- Descriptive analysis limits causal interpretation; further econometric analysis could isolate policy or structural effects.

## 7. Next Steps / Extensions

- Conduct sectoral analysis to identify which industries drive the gender gap in vulnerable employment.
- Examine the relationship between vulnerable employment, education levels, and informality.
- Compare Bosnia and Herzegovina’s trends with other Western Balkan countries to assess regional labor market convergence.
- Explore the impact of EU integration processes, migration, and post-conflict economic restructuring on gendered employment outcomes.
